# Churn-Analysis
Bank Customer Churn Analysis (Power BI) 🚀
Understanding why customers leave is critical for any business, and that’s exactly what this Power BI dashboard aims to do. By analyzing 10K+ bank customers, I explored who is most likely to churn and why—turning raw data into meaningful insights.

📊 Key Insights Uncovered:
🔹 Overall churn rate: 20.4% – A significant portion of customers are leaving. But who are they?
🔹 Age matters: The highest number of customers are 31-40 years old, but churn spikes in the 51-60 group.
🔹 Credit score impact: Customers with lower credit scores (≤400 & 601-700) tend to churn more.
🔹 Account balance trends: People with balances between 10K-100K show the highest churn rates.
🔹 Country-specific churn: Customers from France, Germany, and Spain behave differently when it comes to leaving the bank.
🔹 Product adoption & churn: Certain products have higher drop-off rates, meaning customer engagement isn’t the same across all offerings.
